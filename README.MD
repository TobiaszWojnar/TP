    * #### Requirements
        * Application should enable issuing invoices with many items, each item has product, it's price and quantity.
        * Application should enable adding and showing invoices for specific clients.
        * No complicated GUI or saving data is required.
        * Use `Maven`, create unit tests, use `PMD` and `Checkstyle` plugins.
        * Create ULM class diagram.
        * Design system with GRASP rule. Propose usage of Mocking Objects.

    * #### What I Learned
        * better understanding usage of `Maven`.
        * Usage of UML plugins (`Skech It!` and `PlantUML`).
